## Slim Play App

Wanna build a really, really slim Play project?

This project demonstrates how you can easily build a non-blocking, threadsafe, and fast Play app without having to
use the default `routes` file. The end-result should be familiar territory for people who are used to the simplicity of Sinatra/Bottle
but want to take advantage of Scala's concurrent, type-safe and scalable nature.

### Templates

For [Typesafe activator](https://www.typesafe.com/activator/templates): `$ activator new my-slim-project slim-play-scala`

For [Giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8): `$ g8 lloydmeta/slim-play`

### How to run

1. Git clone this project or use [a template](#templates)
2. `./activator run` from the project's root directory
3. Open a browser and hit:
  - [Hello $name endpoint](http://localhost:9000/hello/beachape)
  - [Async Sqrt calculator](http://localhost:9000/sqrt/1764)

### How it was built

All I did was:

1. Use activator to generate a new Play app (`$ activator new slim-play play-scala`)
2. Delete the auto-generated controller, public, and view directories (won't be using them)
3. Create a `AppLoader.scala` file in the `./app` directory, which holds an ApplicationLoader and the router, which is
  super simple:

  ```scala
  val router = Router.from {
    case GET(p"/hello/$to") => Action {
      Ok(s"Hello $to")
    }
    /*
     Use Action.async to return a Future result (sqrt can be intense :P)
     Note the use of double(num) to bind only numbers (built-in :)
     */
    case GET(p"/sqrt/${double(num)}") => Action.async {
      Future {
        Ok(Math.sqrt(num).toString)
      }
    }
  }
  ```

4. Add `play.application.loader=AppLoader` to `./conf/application.conf` so that Play knows to load our custom app (that
  contains our simple router)
